I"­<p>My name is Axel and - I created this blog as an extra motivation regarding my evolution in data science. I will try to post at least once a week regarding:</p>
<ul>
  <li>My experience in data science</li>
  <li>Feedback about the concepts I will learn during that projet</li>
</ul>

<p>I am freshly graduated with a masters in electrical engineering in Grenoble-inp, France. I worked six months in a project regarding <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/project-profile-cyder-cyber-physical-co-simulation-platform-distributed-energy-resources">the impact of decentralized energy on the Californianâ€™s distribution grid</a>. There I learned the basic of data visualization with python. I also got the chance to take a few summer classes in machine learning - at UC Berkeley. Data science really sparked my interest. After finishing my masters, Iâ€™ve had time to grow my skills in this field before starting my working life.</p>

<p>Â My purpose is to gain enough knowledge in data science to be able to find a job in this field related to the energy market.Â </p>
