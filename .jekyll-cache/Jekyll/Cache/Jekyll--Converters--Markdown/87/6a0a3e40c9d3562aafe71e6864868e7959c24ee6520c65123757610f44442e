I"Y<h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>
<p>Hey, here you can follow my progress in data science. Bellow I have mapped <strong>the learning path</strong> I am following. I will update that path as I discover more content. Of course, it is not an exhaustive list.</p>

<p>In the sidebar, you can also find a section where I gather all <a href="http://localhost:4000/my_blog/project">the projects I am working on</a> - and <a href="http://localhost:4000/my_blog/teaching">a teaching section</a> where I explain the knowledge I have learned.</p>

<h2 id="1--first-step-in-data-science">1.  First step in data science</h2>
<p>First of all, to have a better insight into what I will learn, I tried to resume <a href="first_article">the job of a data scientist</a>. Then I read <em>Vishal Maini &amp; Samer Sabri</em>’s book - <a href="https://everythingcomputerscience.com/books/Machine%20Learning%20for%20Humans.pdf">Machine learning for human</a>.</p>

This is a good resource to start, this book gives a good overview of this broad subject. It is easy to understand for a first time in ML - a good mixte between analogies, exemples and technical explanation. You will find a lot of different resources to go deeper in the different fields - projects, videos, free books and so much more. The authors give as well some interesting personal advice at the end of the book.

#### What I have learned?
  - good insight and first intuition about the different fields of Machine Learning

## 2. Math and Python basics

- Python basics: already do with my background. I will do some exercise to refresh and improve my learning skills

- Math  
  * Linear Algebra  
  * Calculus  
  * probability and statistics


## 3.Futur work

- dive into all the link of the book to go a bit deeper in all the learning method

- Dive into Python
  * Python project 
  * Data exploration and data visualization 
  * Python and data science  
  * Data structure and algorithms in python  

- Machine learning   
  * statistical learning  
  * TensorFlow

- Other useful language  
  * SQL 
  * R  
  * Git and version control

&gt; Special thanks to the YouTuber [*Giles McMullen-Klein*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC68KSmHePPePCjW4v57VPQg). This guy gather a lot of different resources about data science. Those videos are superb and motivational. I highly recommend you follow his channel! Most of the content below come from his video ["Can you LEARN DATA SCIENCE for FREE?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTxyviU0Ddo&amp;feature=share&amp;fbclid=IwAR1Ldib0ETlVNsHHEt_TU99SMggVk_AKFvCfd0Zm-THIN7K33spV6-ayTxY)
