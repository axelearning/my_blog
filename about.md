My name is Axel, I create this blog as an extra motivation regarding my evolution in data science. I will try to post at least once a week regarding:
-	My experience on data science
-	Feed back about the concept I will learn during that projet

 I am freshly graduated from a master in electrical engineering in Grenoble-inp, France. I worked six mounth in a project regarding [the impact of decentrelised energy on the californian's distribution grid](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/project-profile-cyder-cyber-physical-co-simulation-platform-distributed-energy-resources). There I learned the basic of data vizualisation with python. I also got the chance to take few summer class in machine learning - at Berkeley UC - . Data science really spark my interest. With the end of my master I have more time, I decided to increase my skills on this field before entering into the working life.

 My purpose is to reach enough knowledge in data science to be able to find a job between this field and the energy's market.
