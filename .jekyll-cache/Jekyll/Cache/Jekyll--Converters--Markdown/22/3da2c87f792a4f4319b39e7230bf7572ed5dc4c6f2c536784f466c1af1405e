I"4<p>Today we will speak about one of my favorite hobbies: <strong>Football.</strong> The purpose of this project is to level up my skills in different fields while I am working on a subject I love. We will start from scratch by collecting our own data and end up by designing a <strong>dashboard</strong>. The goal is to find the most prolific soccer players on the season 2019-2020. Just bellow, you can find the final result. Underneath the dashboard, We will roll back the process together and discover how we can create this neat interactive visualization.</p>
