<p>Hey, welcome on bord, here you can follow my progress in data science. Below I have mapped <code class="highlighter-rouge">the learning path</code> I am following. I will update that path as I discover more content. Of course, it is not an exhaustive list.
Progress map:

In the next following sections, we will go through all this different fields.</p>

<h1 id="1--the-big-picture-of-data-science">1.  The big picture of Data Science</h1>
<p>First, it is important to have a good overview of this broad subject. In that purpose, understanding <a href="http://localhost:4000/my_blog/what_does_a_datascientist">the job of a data scientist</a> is primordial. As a resume, I gather in the list and the mind map bellow all the <em>‚Äútools‚Äù</em> you and I will need to master in Data Science:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Learn to code</strong> - Python is an excellent first option with a large community and strong libraries for Data Science</li>
  <li><strong>Data Analysis</strong> to gain insight from data</li>
  <li><strong>Machine Learning</strong> to make prediction and draw conclusion from this insight</li>
  <li>A good understanding of <strong>Math</strong> and <strong>Algorithms</strong> is mandatory</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="2--a-spark-of-motivation">2.  A spark of motivation</h1>
<p>As a spark of motivation I start by understanding the basic of Machine Learning. The goal here is to gain sens and motivation for the futur work in math and code. I recommend Vishal Maini &amp; Samer Sabri‚Äôs book, this is a good resource to start with the big picture of artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>

<p>This series is a guide for getting up-to-speed on high-level machine learning concepts. It is easy to understand with a good mixte between analogies, examples and technical explanation. You will find a lot of different resources to go deeper in the different fields - projects, videos, books and so much more. The authors give as well some interesting personal advice at the end of the book.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-have-learned"><code class="highlighter-rouge">What I have learned?</code></h2>
<ul>
  <li>good insight and first intuition about the different fields of Machine Learning</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="3-math">3. Math</h1>
<p>To have a deeper understanding of machine learning, I review some mathematical knowledge. My goal is about creating mathematical intuition rather than learn the formulas and computation methods.</p>
<h3 id="Ô∏é-introduction-to-linear-algebra-and-calculus">‚úîÔ∏é Introduction to Linear Algebra and Calculus</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab">Essence of Linear Algebra</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr">Essence of Calculus</a>: I highly recommend to see the videos of Grant Sanderson. His visual approach with superb animations will give you a solid conceptualization of those subjects.</p>

<h3 id="Ô∏é-multivariable-calculus">‚úîÔ∏é Multivariable calculus</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus">MVC Khan Academy</a>: Khan Academy and Grant Sanderson worked together in the purpose to create a course with a visual meaning of important tools useful in the field of Multivariable Calculus. I realy enjoy the part on Maxima and Minima and Constrained Optimization. You will learn about Gradient, Laplacian, Lagrangian multiplier and so on.</p>

<h3 id="Ô∏é-probability-and-statistics">‚úîÔ∏é Probability and Statistics</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability">Statistics and probability Khan Academy</a>: This interactive and well-designed course provides an introduction to important tools as Regression, Confidence Intervals, Significance Test and so much more.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-have-learned-1"><code class="highlighter-rouge">What I have learned?</code></h2>
<ul>
  <li>review the important tools of Multivariable Calculus and Statistics</li>
  <li>obtain a deep visual understanding of those concepts</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="4data-analysis">4.Data Analysis</h1>
<p>If you want to get into Data Science, you have to know how to manipulate data. Most of your time, as a data scientist engineer, will be spend on manipulating, analysing and getting data ready for modeling. <strong>I recommend to perform data analysis with pandas</strong>, the popular open source library for data analysis in Python.</p>

<p>One of the creator of pandas, Wes McKinney, wrote a book called <em>‚ÄúPython Data Analysis‚Äù</em> and it is a really good choice for learning data analysis in Python. <strong>This book show you how to solve a broad set of data analysis problems effectively</strong>. You will get complete instructions for manipulating, processing, cleaning, and crunching dataset. It is well written and the real-world examples are really usefull to understand the workflow of data analysis in Python.</p>

<p>As a complement, in <a href="https://matterhorn.dce.harvard.edu/engage/ui/index.html#/2016/01/14328">the Harvard course on Data science</a>, you will find great lectures on data analysis. I really recommend to at least take a look to <a href="https://matterhorn.dce.harvard.edu/engage/player/watch.html?id=4dc7719e-1ef4-4ee5-a9d9-fc48c3e13185">Exploratory Data Analysis and effective Visualizations</a>, you will discover some usefull principles for effective visualization.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-have-learned-2"><code class="highlighter-rouge">What I have learned?</code></h2>
<ul>
  <li>use flexible tools to load, clean, transform, merge, and reshape data</li>
  <li>create informative visualization with matplotlib</li>
  <li>apply the pandas groupby facility to slice, dice and summurize datasets</li>
  <li>manipulate time series data</li>
  <li>learn how to solve real world data analysis problems with detailed examples</li>
</ul>
