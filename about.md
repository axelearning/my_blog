My name is Axel and - I created this blog as an extra motivation regarding my evolution in data science. I will try to post at least once a week regarding:
-	My experience in data science
-	Feedback about the concepts I will learn during that projet

I am freshly graduated with a masters in electrical engineering in Grenoble-inp, France. I worked six months in a project regarding [the impact of decentralized energy on the Californian's distribution grid](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/project-profile-cyder-cyber-physical-co-simulation-platform-distributed-energy-resources). There I learned the basic of data visualization with python. I also got the chance to take a few summer classes in machine learning - at UC Berkeley. Data science really sparked my interest. After finishing my masters, I've had time to grow my skills in this field before starting my working life.

 My purpose is to gain enough knowledge in data science to be able to find a job in this field related to the energy market.
